# My Capstone project for devCodeCamp's Full Stack Development Bootcamp

This was my 10-day sprint Capstone project that is an all-source basketball website that allows county-level basketball enthusiasts to schedule, view, comment, and coordinate basketball games. Secondary features include being able to view local basketball videos, local basketball game listings, and local basketball news.
