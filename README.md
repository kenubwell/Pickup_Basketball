# My Capstone project for devCodeCamp's Full Stack Development Bootcamp

This was my 10-day sprint Capstone project that is an all-inclusive basketball website that allows county-level basketball enthusiasts to schedule, view, comment, and coordinate basketball games. Secondary features to the website include being able to view local basketball videos, local basketball game listings, and local basketball news.

Technologies: Django, Django REST Framework, React.js, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Postman, Axios, JWT, FullCalendar.io, and various third-party APIs.
